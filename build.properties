# This is an ant properties file that configures the BootsFaces ant build on your
# local workstation.
# You may need to update the properties in this file to match your
# machine's configuration, installation locations, source working directories, etc.
# to compile a build.
#
# If you are using windows paths with backslashes, you'll need to use c:\\dir1\\dir2
# rather than c:\dir1\dir2 to refer to paths -- Java thinks a single backslash
# is an escape character followed by a control character.
